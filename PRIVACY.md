# Privacy Policy for QueryMySheet

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

Thank you for using QueryMySheet! This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application. QueryMySheet is designed with privacy in mind, and we aim to be transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Process

QueryMySheet processes the following information solely to provide its core functionality:

1.  **Spreadsheet Data:** When you provide a Google Sheet URL or upload a spreadsheet file (.csv, .xls, .xlsx), the content of that sheet is accessed by the application.
    *   **How it's used:** This data is processed locally within your browser (or on the backend infrastructure solely for processing your request) and relevant portions are sent along with your query to the OpenAI API to understand the context and generate an answer.
    *   **Storage:** **We do not store your spreadsheet data on our servers.** The data is processed ephemerally to answer your query.

2.  **Natural Language Queries:** The questions you type into the search box are processed to understand your request.
    *   **How it's used:** Your query text, along with relevant context derived from your spreadsheet data, is sent to the OpenAI API to generate a response.
    *   **Storage:** **We do not store your specific queries on our servers.**

## Third-Party Services

*   **OpenAI API:** QueryMySheet utilizes the OpenAI API to process natural language queries and understand spreadsheet context. Data sent to OpenAI (your query and relevant spreadsheet excerpts) is subject to OpenAI's own privacy policies and terms of service. We recommend you review OpenAI's Privacy Policy: [https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)

## Information We Do Not Collect

*   **Personal Information:** We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect personal information like your name, email address, or location.
*   **Cookies and Tracking:** We do not use tracking cookies or engage in user activity tracking for advertising purposes. Any cookies used are strictly for essential application functionality (if applicable).

## Data Security

We implement reasonable measures to protect the information during processing. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Data sent to third-party services like OpenAI is subject to their security practices.

## Children's Privacy

QueryMySheet is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
